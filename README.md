# My Todo List App

They say you aren't a "real developer" if you don't know who to make a todo list app.

So I made mine:
https://itsvictoroyedeji.github.io/todo-list-app/

No AI code. I made this to learn how to build one from scratch.

And it took 3 1/2 months to finish this -- nearly gave up coding to chase a shiny object. Got back to my senses, then came back to finish this.

Enjoy. Works for mobile as well.
